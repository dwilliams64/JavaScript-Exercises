// 1. Write function to that reverses string

// 2. Write function that prints the average score of students
// and tells who has lowest grade

const myStudents = [
    {
        name: 'Chris',
        grade: 65
    },

    {
        name: 'Rebeeca',
        grade: 100
    },

    {
        name: 'Claire',
        grade: 85
    },

    {
        name: 'Leon',
        grade: 66
    }
];

// 3. Write function that takes array as argument
// and returns array of only even numbers

// 4. Write a function that returns the total sum
// of all numbers inside of gameboard

const gameBoard = [
	[ 4, 32, 8, 4 ],
	[ 64, 8, 32, 2 ],
	[ 8, 32, 16, 4 ],
	[ 2, 8, 4, 2 ]
];

// 5. Write a small guessing game, that takes in the user input for user guess
// have the number be random. Game ends when user guesses random number (hint use while loop).

// 6. Write a guessing program using a while loop and the keyword break. Use and compare two
// random numbers.  When a random number is is equal to the other random number break out of while
// loop.

// 7. Write function that uses for of to loop through:

let subreddits = [ 'soccer', 'popheads', 'cringe', 'books' ];

// have function return the length of each string and upper case each string

// 8. Write a function that either uses traditinal for loop or for of loop
// to combine two words from different arrays at the same indices:

const words1 = [ 'mail', 'milk', 'bath', 'black' ];
const words2 = [ 'box', 'shake', 'tub', 'berry' ];

// Example one return should be mailbox
// Did you use for loop or for of loop? And why?

// 9. Write a function that prints the sum of each sub array
// Print should row summed to summed total for that row:

const magicSquare = [ [ 2, 7, 6 ], [ 9, 5, 1 ], [ 4, 3, 8 ] ];

// have one function use for loop and the other use for of loop.
// Which one do you think is easier?

// 10. Write a function returns a string that says:

// "You rated movieX - movieX-score" using the following object:

const movieReviews = {
	Arrival                : 9.5,
	Alien                  : 9,
	Amelie                 : 8,
	'In Bruges'            : 9,
	Amadeus                : 10,
	'Kill Bill'            : 8,
	'Little Miss Sunshine' : 8.5,
	Coraline               : 7.5
};

// Using the same object write a function that returns the average
// of all scores for the movies in the object.

// Write a function that does the above tasks but uses a for in loop instead.
